# P2: Visualizing Political Leaders# p2

This d3 tutorial was used to base interaction logic on: https://github.com/UBC-InfoVis/447-materials/tree/25Jan/tutorials/5_D3_Tutorial_MV_Advanced_Interactivity

This sandbox d3 tutorial was used as well. I referenced barchart.js, scatterplot.js, main.js, and css files for interaction structure and styling help. https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/UBC-InfoVis/2021-436V-examples/tree/master/d3-linked-charts-basic?file=%2Fjs%2Fmain.js%3A17%2C1 

ChatGPT was used as a reference for d3 syntax and writing helper functions.

Prettier - vscode extention - was used to format code, no logic changed.
